# Documentation

This is the documentation for Inga, a new programming language designed for building web applications. Inga is a declarative, component-based language that combines the best features of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a single syntax. It is designed to be easy to learn and use, while also being powerful enough to build complex applications.
Inga is built on top of the Pug template engine, which allows for a clean and concise syntax that is easy to read and write. Inga also includes built-in support for state management, reactivity, and a component system that makes it easy to build reusable UI components. Inga is designed to work seamlessly with Node.js, allowing developers to use the same language for both client-side and server-side code.
